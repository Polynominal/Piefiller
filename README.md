# Piefiller
Graphical profiler for Love2D 0.10.2
# Usage
1) require the file:
```lua
  piefiller = require("piefiller")
```
2) make a new instance of piefiller
```lua
  Pie = piefiller:new()
```
3) attach the piefiller to the part of your application that you want to monitor, it can be whatever but I suggest calling it in love.update or love.draw as this is what piefiller is all about.

```lua
 function love.update()
	Pie:attach()
		-- do something
	Pie:detach()
 end
```
4) draw the output in your draw function and give event hooks for your pie.
```lua
 function love.draw()
	Pie:draw()
 end
 function love.keypressed(...)
 	Pie:keypressed(...)
 end
 function love.mousepressed(...)
 	Pie:mousepressed(...)
 end
```
5) When you get sufficient output press the "P" key to output to file.
# Keys
r 	= resets the pie 

up 	= decreases depth 

down 	= increases depth 

, 	= decreases step size 

.	= increases step size 

s	= shortens the names displayed

c	= hides/shows hidden processes

p	= saves to file called "Profile" and opens directory for you
## To redefine these:
Modes available:
```lua
reset
increase_depth
decrease_depth
increase_step_size
decrease_step_size
shorten_names
show_hidden
save_to_file
```
To redefine only one of the keys:

```lua
piefiller:setKey(mode,key)
```

example:

```lua
piefiller:setKey("increase_depth","up")
```
To redefine all of the keys:
```lua
	
table = {
	"increase_depth" = "up"
}
piefiller:setKey(table)
	
```
# For your own interpretation 
	If you wish to interpret the data on your own use piefiller:unpack().
	Output is a table as such:
	
```lua
	data = {
		items = { 
			{ 
				name,
				line_defined, 
				current_line,
				source,
				time_taken, 
				percentage,
				caller,
			}
		}, 
		about = {
			depth,
			step, 
			totalTime,
		}, 
	} 
```
	
# Additional notes
The best depth to search for is 2 and 3.

When used in large applications the output is difficult to read, however printing to file resolves this issue.
# Planned features
Make sure that text does not overlay.
